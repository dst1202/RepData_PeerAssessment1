activityData <- read.table(file = dataFile, sep = ",", header = TRUE, na.strings = "NA")
activityData$date <- as.Date(activityData$date, format = "%Y-%m-%d")
head(activityData)
str(activityData)
xtabs(steps ~ date, data = activityData)
```

## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?

```{r}
plot(xtabs(steps ~ date, data = activityData), type = "h", ylab = "Steps", xlab = "Date")
```

## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?
weekdays(unique(activityData$date)
